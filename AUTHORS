The idea of a CRAM-to-BAM conversion filesystem was conceived within the
Human Genetics Informatics department, at the Wellcome Trust Sanger
Institute, in early 2015 by Joshua Randall. The implementation and
development of 13 Amp was taken on by Christopher Harrison, also a
member of HGI, later that year.
