Notes
-----

1. If the source directory contains the mount directory, it all goes
   horribly wrong! Unfortunately, there is apparently no way of
   ascertaining the location of the mount directory (because it's not
   necessarily static[*]), thus I don't see a way of checking for and
   then excluding anything that resolves to the mount directory.
